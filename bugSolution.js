The solution involves verifying your Expo CLI version, updating your project's `package.json` to reflect the correct dependencies and Expo SDK version. Next, ensure all dependencies are properly installed. If the error continues, check your project's `app.json` or `expo.json` for any configuration errors. If you're using a custom build setup, review the configuration settings and make sure they align with the Expo documentation for your CLI and SDK version.
